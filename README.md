DSA_HW1 : Problem 4 - Evil Eval (100 pts)
Problem Description
In this problem, you “simply” have to implement a calculator like what has been taught in
the classes. The calculator should support the following operator on double-precision floating
points with correct precedence:
• arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
• parentheses: (, )
It is guaranteed that the divisor would not be zero during the process of the calculation.
Please do not try to solve this problem by calling other program in your source code. If (and
only if) you patiently, wholeheartedly code the homework out, you will gain a better coding
skill and a deeper understanding of the data structure!
Input
The input contains T lines, each representing an arithmetic expression.
Output
For each test case print a double-precision floating point number in one line, which indicates
the answer of the expression. Your solution will be considered correct if the absolute or relative
error between the answer and your output is less than 10−12. Formally, let your answer be a,
and the jury’s answer be b, your answer is accepted if and only if |a−b|
max(1,|b|) ≤ 10−12
Constraints
• 0 < the length of each line L < 106
• 0 < ai < 108
for each number ai
in the expression
• L · T ≤ 106
• every numbers in the input will be an integer containing only of digits. We expect the
final output to be a floating point number, though.
